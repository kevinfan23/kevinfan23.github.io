				The vibrant and ephemeral fireworks are our area of study. 
				Explosives are propelled into the sky, heated and blossomed into different directions, illuminating and dying out gradually as time passes. 
				We can view fireworks as a particle system in physics, so as a relationship between sky/air and various chemical elements.
				In this relationship, heat, chemical chain, and momentum are catalysts and results of this occurrence. 
				Smell, sight, hearing etc. are our receivers of observing this process.

				In this two-dimensional representation of fireworks. 
				We further examine and imagine the relationships between chemical explosives and the combustion-supporting objects.
				The flammability or non-flammability of various elements in the sky determine the process and results of fireworks.
				By volume, dry air contains 78.09% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon, 0.04% carbon dioxide, and small amounts of other inert gases.
				The ~20% oxygen content in atmosphere permits the gunpowder encapsulated in the fireworks to combust efficiently, generate heat and catapult the burning of other chemical elements, which produce various colors.
				It is this very composition of air prevents the burning process to propagate further into the air itself, as none of the ingredients of air is flammable.
				What remains in the air after combustion is only the smoke and free-falling particles of the debris.

				However, imagine that air is flammable, just as easily as paper. 
				The overall process and results of fireworks in sky will fundamentally differ from our current perceptions. 
				Apart from the internal combustion of all chemicals and gunpowder, the medium, air itself will further propagate this burning process and be highly involved in the aftermath of fireworks in the sky. 
				In this sense, we represent air with paper and try to reimagine the relationship between fireworks and air. 
				Can this representation familiar enough for us to substitute the already formed perception of what fireworks look like and how they work? 
				Is this a better representation that reveal more characteristics of both fireworks and air?

				Let's continue the exploration of representing the essence of fireworks in 3-dimensions. 
				For me, the most important parts of fireworks are propulsion and explosion. 
				The capsules holding gunpowders are propelled into the sky by the first lifting.
				When the gunpowder reaches a critical point, the elements inside initiate the explosion process.
				For this project, I want to imagine fireworks in an unfamiliar environment yet still catch the essences of fireworks.

				An strange medium for fireworks is water, the very material that prevents the fireworks from igniting and propagate. 
				However, can we choose a different explosive that enables the propulsion and explosion even in this foreign medium.
				Inspired by the sparkles in water, we use air bubbles as the explosives and produce it manually and let it naturally propagate and explode at the critical point.
				Similar to the first propulsion provided by explosion, we use buoyancy to provide the lifting for the explosives (air bubbles).

				I think I'm really digging deep into more of the abstract representation of what fireworks are. 
				In 3D, we see fireworks as the kinematic motion of propulsion and explosion. 
				To refine the concept even more, I think we can call fireworks the transition from linear form into dispersion. 
				While research about this point of view, I found light to be the best carrier for my 4D representation.
				Light, contrary from people's regular conception, embodies a physical phenomenon, wave-particle duality. 
				It's by nature electro-magnetic wave, while in microscopic areas, we see it as particle. 
				This causes light to behave differently when propagating in various media and sizes of areas.

				When research about this area, one phenomenon clearly drew my attention. 
				When light passes through door slits, if the slit is small enough,
				then we can see the whole ray of light got split into multiple strains. 
				It can be explained by the concept of diffraction of light. 
				Because of the wave-particle duality of light, if the diameter of hole is comparable to the wavelength of light,
				we can see waves of light interfere with each other and disperse the original path and energy of light. 
				This is one way we can bifurcate light and dissect this form of wave.

			<p class="des-p">
				
				Another way to disperse light is to change its course of path.
				Or actually, we cannot change the course of light without reflection of refraction.
				However, we can disguise out sight to make us believe that the propagation direction of light has been changed.
				By placing the reflecting areas of light in certain facing directions, we can see the courses of light slightly differed.
				This trick enables us to imagine and reflect the essences of fireworks. 
				We change both the energy and directions of light to resemble the nature of explosion/dispersion. 
				And the regular propagation of light is naturally linear.

				I therefore fabricated this 3-dimensional installation to realize this very concept and challenge of dispersing light.
				By creating a dark room and let light pass through a considerably small slit, we land the light onto this very placement of hard paper sheets.
				The result is a stunning progression of linear propagation of light into two forms of dispersion: energy and course of path.

				The outdoor surroundings of the Fulton Center is also astonishing.
				Situated in the lower Manhattan financial district, the Fulton Center is surrounded by the One World Trade Center and the Oculus.
				As part of the whole rehabilitation project, a new building, the Fulton Building was also built along the east side of Broadway, incorporating the city landmark Corbin Building (the red building shown below).
				A new passageway, Dey Street Passageway, was constructed under Dey Street,
