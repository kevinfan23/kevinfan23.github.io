				<span class="category title">Week 1: 08/30 - Inspirations</span>
				<br>

				My inspirations or interests have always been around the the impact of technology on society.
				Major domains that I have worked with are machine learning, web and mobile development.
				This summer I was using a front-end web frameworks called Vue.js, which I happened to find later that it was developed by a Parsons allumnus called Evan You.
				In the tech spectrum it is not just an ordinary framework, Wired put it best in its article called
				"THE SOLO JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPER CHALLENGING GOOGLE AND FACEBOOK" that Evan and his small team is actually breaking the monopoly of tech giants in the freedom of web.

		<div class="col-12">
			<p class="des-p">

				This really inspired me not only because Evan was a graduate of DT but how a small team of "half designer and half engineer", as how Evan called himself, could drastically shaped the horizon of tech.
				We have long taken it granted that all advances in tech will come from the mammoths in the tech industry like Google, Facebook and Microsoft etc. However, a small group of creative individuals can still make such a huge impact how we use technology.
				The world is going through the so-called 4th industrial revolution with the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
				It makes me wonder, what is the next breakthrough that can kind of restore of past active community of individual app developers and dreamers, instead of being constrained in the big company thinkings.

				<span class="category">Domains</span>
				<br>

				I mapped out my domains and cetegorized them in the following 4 areas.
				After doing that, I realize that all these domains are around the platforms that technologies mainly reside right now.
				The web is the most dynamic and open platform by far, regardless of your hardware specifications, you can open up your browser and explore the internet.
				The native mobile environment is more of a curated platform, where apps have to conform to certain HCI and hardware guidelines to devliver a better user experience.
				Machine learning and AI are the driving force of technological inventions right now. Machine learning is specifically good at automation of tasks, generative analysis and simplifying interfaces by introducing an extra layer of abstraction.

				<br>

				I think it is time to redefine my scope and narrow down my thesis topic to be within an specific domain.
				The question I always have in mind for years is how we organize our professional networks online.
				I go to professional conferences and events often and one of the most important aspect of these kind of professional events
				is the various interaction with speakers and peers. It is essential for any person to cultivate their professional network and
				get to know their community better. However there is no effective product right now to really reach out to people during events while
				not make it awkward to keep those contacts. LinkedIn is not event-focused and Facebook Events requires giving out our personal data online.

				It is quite clear from the start that this product will be used by professional event-goers the most.
				These are the people with regular user needs to either keep up with the industry or get to know their peers at the professional events.
				On the peripheral, this product can also be used to manage and communicate with personal events attendents.
				Professional event-goers and personal event-goers share a lot of similarities:
				they all consist of people who you will develop deeper, longer-going and personal connections later;
				and people who are just of one-sight memories simply because of the spatial and temporal compulsion withint the events.

				I received some of the best advices for my thesis project at this week's crit sessions.
				It was interesting enough to hear about other people's projects too.
				For my topic, I think it is important to consult some phycology professors about my idea of "time-limited relationships";
				and probably really nail down to the current term for it.
				As for the final deliverables, I'm still unsure of what I'm going to make next.
				Personally I'm more towards the practical route, meaning applications or something that can be accessible to all.

				<span class="category title">Week 6: 10/04 - Prototype</span><br>
				<span class="category">In-Class Prototype</span><br>
				For this week's in-class prototyping session, I designed a set of personas/senarios and ask people to interact in 3 senarios.
				The first one is an age 18-25 years old college student who is in school and ready to embark on a carrer after graduation.
				The second one is an age 20-35 years old professional, who is already in the workplace and in the junior-senior level positions within the company.
				Last one is a successful influcencer who already has a huge group of audience and followers and ready to expand his/her empire.
				The goal of my prototype is to examine into what type of events these three groups of people are mostly interested in, most willing to interact with people and the purpose of establishing relationships and communications.
				Within a certain type of events, what event information people are mostly concerned with and how different people reach out for contacts.
				A detailed prototype test can be seen in the link below.

				<span class="category">Design Values</span><br>
				<i>Connectivity with constraints</i><br>
				It could be in fact more encouraging for people to connect with each other if there is clear line of constraints.
				How long our connected session is going to last is an important issue when people first establish relationships.
				By recognizing the constraints first, it opened up more possibilities for people to reach out to each other without the hindersight of building a relationship too fast or too early.

				<br><br><i>Privacy within relationships</i><br>
				Within a relationship, there are various kinds of rapport level.
				Different rapport level therefore requires different modes of communications.
				It is important to recognize that privacy cannot be given up instantly when a relationship is eatablished.
				With an increasing level of rapport, we can finally loosen up the emphasis on privacy but not entirely given away.

				<br><br><i>Purposeful communication with efficiency</i><br>
				Communication with purpose can save a tremendous amount of time compared to our social norm of communication followed after introducted.
				By placing job titles, intent before a communication connection, not only it gives up a choice to either connect or not, but we can jump right into the contents without having to communication about backgroud first.

				1. The tree-like structure is a simple balanced way for both event organizer to scaffold event information and attendants to navigate<br>
				2. People would enjoy an in-app experience when try to contact people<br>
				Knowing that my audience is DT, I have to be aware that all testers are familiar with digital interfaces and aware of other event & chat platforms,

				<i>Mario</i><br>
				- Tree Structure<br>
				1. Needs more visual hierarchy<br>
				2. Encourages to read all event information<br>
				3. Kinda reminds of Slack, it’s good to read them tho<br>
				- DM Feature<br>
				1. Would definitely use it to talk to people if seen in the contacts<br>
				2. Would like to talk to someone of the same position and in a company that he is interested in, ex Dropbox. Find it more accessible to talk to someone in the same career stage as him<br>

				<span class="category">Updated Prototypes</span><br>
				From the feedbacks from last weeks' critic sessions, I decided to shift my thesis to focus more on the ecosystem within a large conference.


				<br><br>
				<i>An Ecosystem within a large conference</i><br>
				People come to professional conferences for various reasons and are of various personalities.
				The transparency of information within an conferene - the ability to visualize the information flowing within an conference - is crucial to the chemstry happens at conferences.
				By laying out the information of people and subsessions needed for the attendents, it is much easier for them to make choices and quickly form sub-groups.
				The transparency also facilitates collaboration within existed teams as well, as all team members activities can be visualized with the help of the application.

				<br><br><i>Event utilities, group communications, and archives</i><br>
				In order to further facilicate a holistic user experience within large conferences, event utilities and other functionalities have to be included within the application.
				Event session informations, group news feed and a channel for members to freely share document can be used to share information and keep a persistent event archive after the event.

				<i>Flowchart</i><br>
				As users navigate through the application, what is the user flow, interface and imaginable interactions users can do with the product.
				During the new phase of prototyping & testing,
				I created a user flow chart and walk the users through each steps of the event experience.
				The feedbacks I got from this prototype is that users still wish to be able to visualize the event experience.
				I tested my prototype in DT, since DTers are my main target audience.

				<br><br><i>High-Fidelity Mockups</i><br>
				For the next prototype, I created some high-fidelity mockups of the user interfaces.
				The main point of this kind of prototype is to test the look and feel of the product and be able to identify more detailed needs and functionalities of the application.
				While some users are confused about certain functionalities, most feedbacks are positive and encouraging.

				Generally my testing process has been successful, since I was able to demonstrate my idea to users and gather valuable feedbacks.
				The central issues I encountered in this prototyping & testing phase is how to explain the idea to users and allow users to freely explore the features.
				However, these latter prototypes are sufficient to address my concept and allow me to gather various feedbacks.
